# Real-Time Edge Detection Camera & Web Viewer

This project is a comprehensive technical demonstration of a high-performance, real-time video processing pipeline on Android, coupled with a modern TypeScript-based web viewer for displaying the output.

Here are screenshots of the application in action, showing both the normal camera feed and the live edge-detected feed.

## âœ… Features Implemented

### **Android Application:**

* **Live Camera Feed:** Captures a high-framerate video stream using Android's modern **CameraX API**.
* **Real-Time C++ Processing:** Sends every camera frame to a native C++ layer via the **JNI (Java Native Interface)** for maximum performance.
* **OpenCV Edge Detection:** Utilizes the powerful **OpenCV** library in C++ to apply a Canny edge detection filter to each frame.
* **GPU-Powered Rendering:** Displays the final processed video smoothly using a custom **OpenGL ES 2.0** renderer, ensuring the UI remains fast and responsive.
* **Interactive Toggle:** A simple on-screen button to switch between the original camera feed and the live edge-detected view.

### **Web Viewer:**

* **TypeScript Project:** A modern web front-end built with **TypeScript** and the **Vite** toolchain.
* **Static Frame Display:** Showcases a sample processed frame saved from the Android application.
* **Stats Overlay:** Displays basic frame statistics (resolution, FPS) using TypeScript to manipulate the DOM.

## ðŸ§  Architecture Overview

The application is built on a multi-layered pipeline that passes data from the high-level Java layer to low-level C++ for efficient processing and back for rendering.
